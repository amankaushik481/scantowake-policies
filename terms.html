        <p>
            Alarm Clock - Scan To Wake is a mobile application that allows users to set alarms that can only be 
            dismissed by scanning a pre-registered barcode or QR code. The App is designed to help users wake up 
            by requiring physical activity to silence the alarm.
        </p>

        <h2>3. License Grant</h2>
        <p>
            We grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to use the App for your
